  Seletive Process for internship vacancy as FUll-Stack developer at Mind Consulting, has given me 4(four) days, to realize this project.

  The project consists of made Login Page with ReactJS - FrontEnd, NODEjs - BackEnd with BCrypt to encrypt the passwords, and use MYsql as Database(DOCKER). 

  Product Catalog that Admin can edit, add, rename and delete those products, so after the login, the user go to this page (product catalog) what means that login page are to owner of the outlet. 
  
  This page (product catalog) are the most harder page to do as a developer since i decided to be a dev, as front-end until then i hadn't made any pages like this, and never thinked bout how to do the backend & database of something like this, so immersed myself in the studies in 2 of these 4 days that were given to me, i tried to understand every step to take so that everything was done in the best possible way even if it was my first time. 

  This page was made with REACTjs, NodeJS & MYsql (DOCKER)

  Front-end i had made with CSS and thinked bout to use Bootstrap, UI/UX i got inspiration fom and old volunteer project in which i participated & cause i have so many designers friends, that inspire me, so i thinked about some colors and interfaces that they gonna like to use. And, cause i want to be a Front End Specialist. Behance have helped me so much in these 2 pages that i made.
